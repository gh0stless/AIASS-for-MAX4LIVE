# AIASS POLY flow

The AIASS POLY flow is a variant of the AIASS POLY in the form of a MAX4LIVE MIDI effect. The only difference is that when the steal mode is switched off, overflowing notes are output at the device output. If you have a 2nd Sidblaster, you can now add a 2nd AIASS POLY flow behind it. This makes 6-note polyphony possible. That works with up to 8 sidblasters :). If the steal mode is switched on, the input notes are looped through.
